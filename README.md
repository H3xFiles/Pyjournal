Trying to give a form to all my python notes. The most important thingg is my [essential reference guide to python](https://github.com/H3xHunter/PythonInterviewRepository/blob/master/python3_reference.md).

## 25/10/2018
For few days I am working on this reference guide, then I'll move to C reference guide.
